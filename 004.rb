# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest
# palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# largest 3 digit number squared is 999^2 = 998001, so largest palindrome must
# be <= 997_799.
# Naive: iterate downward, checking if any product is a palindrome .
# TODO would like to "side step downward", check 999*998, 997*999, but still
# need to check all of the possibilites...

def palindrome? val
  # s = product.to_s
  # return true if s.length == 1
  # return true if s.length == 2 && s[0] == s[1]
  # return false if s[0] != s[-1]
  # palindrome?(s[1..-2])
  val.to_s == val.to_s.reverse
